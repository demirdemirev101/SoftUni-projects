1. Two households, both alike in dignity,
2. In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
3. From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
4. Where civil blood makes civil hands
5. unclean.
6. From forth the fatal loins of these two
7. foes
8. A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their
9. life;
10. Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
11. Do with their death bury their parents'
12. strife.
